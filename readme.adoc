= Nentwich Compose Services
Richard St√∂ckl <richard.stoeckl@aon.at>

This repository ensures an easy installation method for the Nentwich services.

== Requirements

This software requires a running docker daemon and the `docker-compose` command in your path.
Currently, podman is not supported due to missing docker apis.

== Setup

Only a few steps are required for a bare installation of all services:

. clone this repository and all its sub repositories
. copy all examples to the projects root
. startup

You can use the following commands from the projects root:

[source,shell]
----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mknentwich/compose.git
cp -R example .
docker-compose up
----

== Configuration

Most important configuration can be done on the `.env` file.
Examples are enable/disable https, change the domain, set the hugo repository, etc... .
